## Blinx - Hackathon Submission

This repository is created for the hackathon submission via the Devfolio portal, which only allows one GitHub URL. However, our project has separate repositories for the frontend and backend components.

Please find the individual repo links below:

- [Blinx Backend](https://github.com/namish800/blinx): Contains the FastAPI backend and Langgraph agents.
- [Blinx Frontend](https://github.com/namish800/blinx-ui): Contains the frontend code built with Next.js.

For convenience, the source code for both frontend and backend can also be found in this repository under the following paths:
- Backend: [blinx-backend](https://github.com/namish800/blinx-ai-hackathon-submission/tree/main/blinx-backend)
- Frontend: [blinx-ui](https://github.com/namish800/blinx-ai-hackathon-submission/tree/main/blinx-ui)
